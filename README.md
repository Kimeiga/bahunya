### Thanks

Huge thanks to [Kognise](https://www.kognise.dev/) and all the folks behind [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/). Bahunya needed an enourmous facelift, and I was able to bootstrap (hehe) a lot of work from water.css. 

Huge thanks to [Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com/) and [Filipe Freire](https://filfreire.com/) for creating [Tacit](https://yegor256.github.io/tacit/), a fantastic classless CSS framework that inspired this project. I felt that Tacit was good, but I wanted responsive typography, vertical rhythm, a navbar, better web safe fonts, dark color theme, code syntax highlighting, and more. So I made Bahunya!
